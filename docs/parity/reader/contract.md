# Reader Parity Notes (Current iOS Surface)

This file describes what "reader parity" currently means in practice on iOS.

It is not trying to be a formal spec. The point is to make it obvious which
reader behaviors are meant to feel Android-like today, even when the native
implementation is different.

Primary code references:

- top-level reader coordinator:
  `Sources/BibleUI/Sources/BibleUI/Bible/BibleReaderView.swift`
- main document controller:
  `Sources/BibleUI/Sources/BibleUI/Bible/BibleReaderController.swift`
- web view coordinator and swipe handling:
  `Sources/BibleView/Sources/BibleView/WebViewCoordinator.swift`
- pane shell:
  `Sources/BibleUI/Sources/BibleUI/Bible/BibleWindowPane.swift`

## Core Reader Shape

The current iOS reader keeps the same basic split Android users expect:

- a document-rendering surface in the WebView
- native coordination for windows, sheets, toolbars, and overlays
- a left navigation drawer for primary reader destinations
- a right overflow popup for reader-local toggles and configuration actions
- Android-parity settings that drive runtime reader behavior

## Reader Shell and Toolbar

At the shell level, iOS is now aiming for the same overall structure and
affordance order as Android:

- a compact toolbar with previous/next navigation bracketing the current
  reference title
- a left hamburger drawer for primary destinations such as Choose Document,
  Search, Speak, Bookmarks, StudyPads, My Notes, Reading Plan, History,
  Downloads, Backup & Restore, Device synchronization, and Application
  preferences
- a right overflow popup for reader-local actions such as Fullscreen, Night
  mode, Workspaces, Tilt to Scroll, split/pinning toggles, Label Settings,
  Section titles, Strong's numbers, Chapter & verse numbers, and All text
  options
- Android-style title/subtitle semantics in the toolbar: the current reference
  plus the active module description

The goal here is the same user-facing structure and flow, not a literal copy of
Android view classes.

## Preference-Driven Reader Behaviors

These Android-origin settings materially affect how the iOS reader behaves:

- `navigate_to_verse_pref`
- `open_links_in_special_window_pref`
- `double_tap_to_fullscreen`
- `auto_fullscreen_pref`
- `disable_two_step_bookmarking`
- `bible_view_swipe_mode`
- `toolbar_button_actions`
- `full_screen_hide_buttons_pref`
- `hide_window_buttons`
- `hide_bible_reference_overlay`
- `show_active_window_indicator`

The settings docs go into more detail, but the reader is where these values
actually become visible.

## Navigation

The reader is also trying to preserve Android-oriented navigation semantics for:

- chapter/page/none swipe modes
- active-window tracking
- current-window vs links-window navigation
- history updates and jump-back navigation
- fullscreen transitions triggered from document interaction

## Chapter-Top and Restore Behavior

These chapter-top and restore details are easy to miss, but they are part of
the current parity expectation:

- chapter separators remain structural content rather than a toggleable visual
  option
- section titles remain preference-driven
- normal restored reading positions must not highlight the current verse as if
  it were an explicit navigation target
- explicit verse-target navigation may still highlight the requested verse/range

## Bookmarking

Reader-side bookmark actions are expected to keep these Android-oriented
behaviors:

- one-step vs two-step bookmarking
- whole-verse vs selection bookmarks
- bridge-driven label assignment entry points
- bookmark updates reflected back into the WebView document

## Display Behavior

The reader still pushes a shared config payload into the WebView surface. That
payload carries several Android-parity display options, including:

- night mode state
- monochrome mode
- animation disablement
- font-size multiplier
- bookmark modal button disablement
- active-window indicator visibility

## Strong's and Dictionary Modal

The Strong's / dictionary flow is now part of reader parity too. On iOS it is
expected to preserve the richer Android-style experience through:

- native bottom-sheet presentation from the reader shell
- a dedicated `contentType: "strongs"` route into the embedded client instead
  of treating Strong's content as generic multi-document content
- per-dictionary tab selection when multiple Strong's dictionaries are installed
- morphology fragments rendered alongside definition fragments when available
- recursive Strong's navigation and `Find all occurrences` handoff from inside
  the modal

This surface is partly native shell and partly embedded-client rendering, so
both layers matter.

## Windows and Compare

The reader is also expected to preserve these multi-window and comparison
behaviors:

- focused window tracking
- special links windows
- compare sheet/module-picker flows
- synchronized window scrolling and active-window signaling
