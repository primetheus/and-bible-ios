/**
 Coordinates Android-aligned remote bootstrap inspection, initial-backup restore, patch replay, and
 outbound patch upload for every currently supported sync category.

 This service mirrors Android's synchronization flow for the currently supported categories:
 - inspect or validate the category bootstrap state
 - surface adopt-versus-create decisions without mutating local data
 - after remote adoption, download and restore `initial.sqlite3.gz`
 - for ready categories, discover, stage, download, and replay incremental remote patches
 - after remote replay, upload one outbound sparse patch when the category supports local export
 - persist Android-aligned `lastPatchWritten` and `lastSynchronized` bookkeeping

 Data dependencies:
 - `RemoteSyncBootstrapCoordinator` validates or creates ready bootstrap state
 - `RemoteSyncPatchDiscoveryService` finds remote initial backups and pending patch archives
 - `RemoteSyncArchiveStagingService` downloads initial-backup and patch archives into temporary files
 - `RemoteSyncInitialBackupRestoreService` restores staged initial backups into local SwiftData
 - category-specific patch apply services replay staged Android patch archives into local SwiftData
 - `RemoteSyncBookmarkPatchUploadService` exports and uploads outbound sparse bookmark patches
 - `RemoteSyncWorkspacePatchUploadService` exports and uploads outbound sparse workspace patches
 - `RemoteSyncReadingPlanPatchUploadService` exports and uploads outbound sparse reading-plan patches
 - `RemoteSyncStateStore` persists Android-aligned bootstrap and progress metadata locally
 - `RemoteSyncPatchStatusStore` records patch zero after remote initial-backup adoption, matching Android

 Side effects:
 - performs remote backend listing, download, marker, and device-folder creation requests
 - may restore a full staged initial backup into local SwiftData
 - may replay staged remote patches into local SwiftData and local-only fidelity stores
 - may upload one outbound sparse bookmark, workspace, or reading-plan patch and rewrite local baseline metadata after success
 - persists bootstrap, patch-status, and progress metadata through `SettingsStore`
 - creates and removes temporary staged archive files beneath the configured temporary directory

 Failure modes:
 - throws `RemoteSyncSynchronizationError.missingInitialBackup` when a remotely adopted folder has no `initial.sqlite3.gz`
 - rethrows remote transport failures from the backend adapter
 - rethrows archive staging, initial-backup restore, discovery, and patch-apply failures from the lower layers
 - only reverts `lastSynchronized` automatically for Android's incompatible-patch-version branch

 Concurrency:
 - this type is not `Sendable`; callers must respect the confinement requirements of the supplied
   `SettingsStore` and `ModelContext`
