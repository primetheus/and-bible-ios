/**
 Coordinates Android-aligned remote bootstrap decisions for one sync backend.

 This coordinator mirrors the non-UI portions of Android's `CloudSync.initializeSync()` flow:
 - validate any locally stored sync-folder ownership marker
 - clear stale bootstrap state when the marker is missing or incomplete
 - discover same-named remote folders that may need an adopt-vs-create decision
 - persist the chosen sync folder, device folder, and secret marker after adoption or creation

 Data dependencies:
 - `RemoteSyncAdapting` performs remote listing, folder creation, deletion, and secret-marker work
 - `RemoteSyncStateStore` persists Android-aligned bootstrap metadata locally

 Side effects:
 - inspection may clear stale bootstrap keys in `RemoteSyncStateStore`
 - adoption and creation upload secret markers, create remote device folders, and persist state
 - create-with-replacement can delete a previously discovered remote folder before recreating it

 Failure modes:
 - rethrows backend transport errors from the adapter
 - local state writes are best-effort because `RemoteSyncStateStore` is backed by `SettingsStore`
   which swallows persistence failures

 Concurrency:
 - this type is intentionally not `Sendable`; callers must respect the thread/actor confinement of
   the `SettingsStore` and SwiftData context captured by `RemoteSyncStateStore`
