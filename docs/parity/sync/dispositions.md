# iOS Sync Parity Dispositions

This file records explicit iOS sync dispositions where behavior is intentionally
extended or constrained relative to Android.

## 1. iCloud remains a first-class iOS backend

- Status: intentional iOS extension
- Scope: backend picker and sync settings surface

Disposition:

- iOS keeps `ICLOUD` as a first-class backend alongside the Android-aligned
  remote backends.
- This does not replace or redefine the Android parity contract for
  `NEXT_CLOUD` and `GOOGLE_DRIVE`.

Reason:

- CloudKit is already a shipped iOS-native sync path and must coexist with the
  Android-style remote sync implementation during parity rollout.

## 2. Google Drive is code-ready but operationally parked

- Status: intentional operational constraint
- Scope: Google Drive backend

Disposition:

- The repo contains the Google Drive transport, auth service, settings flow,
  and test coverage.
- End-user Google Drive sync is still parked until a real iOS OAuth client is
  provisioned for the app bundle.

Reason:

- iOS requires build-time bundle OAuth configuration and callback URL scheme
  wiring before Google Sign-In can complete successfully.
- This is a release/developer setup dependency, not a user workflow.

- [../../howto/google-drive-oauth-setup.md](../../howto/google-drive-oauth-setup.md)

## 3. WebDAV persisted key names remain Android-compatible

- Status: intentional compatibility preservation
- Scope: NextCloud / WebDAV settings persistence

Disposition:

- iOS preserves Android-compatible raw preference keys such as
  `gdrive_server_url`, `gdrive_username`, `gdrive_folder_path`, and
  `gdrive_password` even though they now back NextCloud/WebDAV configuration on
  iOS.

Reason:

- The awkward names are part of the cross-platform persistence contract and
  should not be "cleaned up" casually if the goal is Android compatibility.

## 4. Adopt-versus-create stays explicit

- Status: intentional UX preservation
- Scope: same-named remote folder handling

Disposition:

- iOS does not silently adopt or overwrite a discovered remote folder.
- The user must explicitly choose whether to restore from the remote baseline
  or replace the remote folder with local state.

Reason:

- This matches Android's top-level synchronization branch point and avoids
  accidental destructive behavior during remote bootstrap.
