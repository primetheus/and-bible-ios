# Sync Parity

This directory holds Android-aligned sync parity documentation for iOS.

## Reading Order

1. [contract.md](contract.md): current sync contract and supported flows
2. [dispositions.md](dispositions.md): explicit iOS deviations and operational constraints

Operational companion docs:

- [../../howto/google-drive-oauth-setup.md](../../howto/google-drive-oauth-setup.md):
  developer/release guidance for the parked Google Drive OAuth dependency

## Scope

This subtree is for parity-sensitive sync behavior:

- backend selection semantics
- category coverage
- bootstrap/adopt/create flows
- initial-backup and patch behavior
- explicit iOS divergences from Android

It is not the place for one-off local task tracking or release checklists.
