# Bridge Parity Notes (Current iOS Surface)

This file explains how the iOS bridge is currently trying to stay compatible
with the Android-facing web client.

It is written as a guide to the moving parts, not as a formal transport spec.

Primary code references:

- bridge host and Android compatibility shim:
  `Sources/BibleView/Sources/BibleView/BibleWebView.swift`
- bridge dispatcher and delegate protocol:
  `Sources/BibleView/Sources/BibleView/BibleBridge.swift`
- main native delegate implementation:
  `Sources/BibleUI/Sources/BibleUI/Bible/BibleReaderController.swift`

## Core Transport Shape

The shared frontend still expects Android-style bridge semantics, even on iOS.

### JavaScript to native

The effective transport shape on iOS is:

```javascript
window.webkit.messageHandlers.bibleView.postMessage({ method, args })
```

But the web client is still allowed to call Android-style APIs such as
`window.android.addBookmark(...)` because iOS injects an Android compatibility
shim before the page loads.

### Native to JavaScript

Native code sends events back through:

```javascript
bibleView.emit(event, data)
```

### Async responses

Deferred requests use the shared `callId` pattern:

```javascript
bibleView.response(callId, value)
```

That contract must remain stable across Android and iOS.

## Message Shape

The best place to understand the current message surface is still the
`BibleBridgeDelegate` protocol together with the dispatcher switch in
`BibleBridge`.

Current message groups:

- navigation and scroll position
- bookmark CRUD and label actions
- content actions such as share, copy, compare, and speak
- StudyPad and My Notes actions
- dialogs, reference parsing, and help
- client state/reporting messages

The main parity risk here is casual drift in shared method names, argument
ordering, or response expectations.

## Event Shape

Current native-to-JS event groups include:

- document/config lifecycle (`set_config`, `clear_document`, `add_documents`,
  `setup_content`)
- navigation/scrolling (`scroll_to_verse`, `scroll_down`, `scroll_up`)
- bookmark and label updates (`add_or_update_bookmarks`, `delete_bookmarks`,
  `update_labels`)
- StudyPad updates
- selection and active-window state

If event names or payload shapes change, both iOS and Android should be treated
as affected.

## Compatibility Shim

iOS currently preserves Android-oriented frontend assumptions by injecting:

- `window.__PLATFORM__ = 'ios'`
- `window.android = new Proxy(...)`
- a synchronous `getActiveLanguages()` cache via `window.__activeLanguages__`

This shim is part of the parity story, not incidental glue. The Vue bundle
still relies on Android-style bridge calls in multiple places.

## Payload Shape

Swift payload definitions live in:

- `Sources/BibleView/Sources/BibleView/BridgeTypes.swift`

The corresponding TypeScript-side expectations live under:

- `bibleview-js/src/types/`

Payload drift is a high-risk change because it often fails at runtime without a
compile-time signal.

## Document Routing

The embedded client now relies on document routing that is broader than the
top-level `type` field alone.

Important current examples:

- generic multi-fragment content still routes through `type: "multi"`
- Strong's / dictionary modal content routes through:
  - `type: "multi"`
  - `contentType: "strongs"`
  - optional Strong's modal state such as selected dictionary tabs

In other words, it is no longer enough to think "this is just a multi
document." The safe mental model is:

- emit the correct multi-document content type
- preserve the route-specific state fields the client expects
- keep the Swift payload shape aligned with the corresponding TypeScript types

This matters most for the Strong's modal because losing
`contentType: "strongs"` silently drops the richer Android-style tabbed path
and falls back to generic multi-document rendering.
